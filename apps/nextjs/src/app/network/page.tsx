          Realms L3 exists to enable the ambitious Realms Autonomous World. It
          is a collaboration between Bibliotheca DAO and Cartridge, designed and
          built around the dojo stack. This stack has been optimized for
          high-performance onchain gaming, allowing Realms L3 to support the
          demanding requirements of the autonomous world.

          {" "}
          Realms.World L3 stands as a high-performance zkVM network,
          specifically engineered to support high-performance onchain gaming.
          The network operates as a Starknet sequencer, ensuring that any
          Starknet contract can seamlessly run on the network. Sitting atop the
          public Starknet L2, it rolls-up its state onto Starknet. This allows
          for low transactions fees, high performance and high security
          guarantees. The entire stack is opensource and welcomes contributions.
